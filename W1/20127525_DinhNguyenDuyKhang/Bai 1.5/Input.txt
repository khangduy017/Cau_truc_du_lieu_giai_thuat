Don't you worry just follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains of valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in
Just let me in
[Verse 2: Emelie Hollow]
She knew she was hypnotised
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again
Then she ran faster than
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say
[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains of valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in
Just let me in
[Bridge: Emelie Hollow]
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
